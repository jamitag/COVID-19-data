# Love recipes

## Welcome - [Love recipes](https://jamitag.github.io/love-recipes/)
This terminal based programme is designed to produce a list of recipes based on the users preference. Interacting with an external database ([spoonacular](https://spoonacular.com/)), the user will receive a variation of recipes based upon their preferred cuisine and/or dietary requirements.


## How it works

Upon running the programme, the user is prompted to select the type of recipe they’re interested in e.g. “italian vegetarian”.

Using this combination of cuisines and/or dietary requirements, the API will return a list of ten recipes.

The resulting list of ten recipes is indexed and the user is further prompted to select a recipe by inputting the relevant number.

Once selected, the chosen recipe is displayed to the user and shown details including ingredients and quantities.

The user is further prompted to answer if they would like the view the instructions for chosen recipe. Answering ‘Y’ will display the steps to make the recipe. Answering ’N’ will restart the programme.
